# Assignment 2
In this assignment we implement Facial Recognition using one-shot learning. The implemention is based on the paper: [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf).

**Task:** Given two facial images of previously unseen persons, our architectu
re will have to successfully
determine whether they are the same person.

### Dataset
We used the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/index.html) dataset (LFW-a version)
